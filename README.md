## **About the program:**

This program is designed to accurately guess the Wordle word of the day. To do this it makes use of a possible answers dictionary pulled from the site, and a dictionary of common words that are more likely to appear as the word of the day. To make the best possible guess, the program counts the appearance of each character and its position in each word, then compares occurrences so that its guess eliminates as many alternate words as possible.


## **Running the program:**

Simply run app.java and follow terminal prompts to run this program.
